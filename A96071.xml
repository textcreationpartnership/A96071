         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Introduction.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I firſt gave vent to theſe night Meditations by penning them, I had much debate with my ſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conceal or publiſh them were moſt comely and convenient; when I recollected the frequent prejudices that attend good meanings, and the great <hi>odium</hi> that is caſt on ſerious men by thoſe triflers, whoſe utmoſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition it is to blaſt the bleſſed fruit of Vertue, by their unbenign breathes of detraction, and how few there are of the Genteel World, that think any thing more poyſie then <hi>Romances,</hi> worthy their peruſal; I condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it to the heap of waſt Papers, as that which curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eyes would view with regret, and captious natures peruſe with little calmneſs.</p>
            <p>But for as much as I have hitherto often offended God, (I will accuſe my ſelf and humbly implore his pardon) in ſacrificing by fire many (though not beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, yet undisfigured) children of my fancy, to ſilence, upon the Altar, and on the account of Modeſty, or perhaps Security, leſt like unnatural <hi>Abſaloms</hi> they ſhould ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot againſt their Parent: My reſolution for the future is, and by Gods help ſhall be, to preſerve ſuch bleſſings of God on my Studies as Memorials of his Mercy, and Excitations to my Gratitude.</p>
            <p>In all earthly things there is change and ſorrow, yea, the beſt Commodity our Nature trafficks in, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brings home loſs, or diſquiet; there is a toyl in
<pb facs="tcp:153739:3"/>multitude of Books, and a kind trouble in common friendſhip; in the Favour of God only is Life, and in his Acquaintance Peace; the experience whereof made me methodize this Meditation, and now print it.</p>
            <p>In the latter clauſe of the counſel to <hi>Job,</hi> which moſt Verſions read by <hi>Thereby ſhal good come unto thee,</hi> or <hi>So ſhalt thou have the beſt fruits,</hi> or <hi>So ſhalt thou have proſperity,</hi> or <hi>So ſhall good things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto thee,</hi> or <hi>So ſhall thy fruit be in good things;</hi> or <hi>In them is good increaſed:</hi> I have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it, <hi>So ſhall no evil come unto thee,</hi> which I humbly conceive is pardonable, the peace of God in the former clauſe couching the good things of acquaintance with God; and alſo there being no good, truly ſo called, which this protection from evil comprehends not; for what ever defends us from the Fallacies of Satan, this world and our own hearts, muſt needs leave us in Gods Bleſſing, as meet Objects of his Mercy and Bounty. I will here conclude with this humble Petition to God, That he would pardon the temerity of my pen, and accept of my plea in <hi>Ephraims</hi> bemoaning words, <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh, I was aſhamed, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. <hi>31.19.</hi> And I truſt that he that <hi>breaketh not the bruiſed reed, and quencheth not the ſmoaking flax,</hi> will not refuſe this offering at my hand.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Was a competent and congruous Definition of Man which the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher gave, when he called him a ſociable Creature, the nature of man being more receptive and ſparſive of good then any Creature, which hath not reaſon to diſtinguiſh, and entertain what it knows to be uſefull and conducing to content; for though all creatures have the imperfect and firſt lines of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation effigiated on them, and in ſome degree or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153739:4"/>other affect their own ſpecies, or other creatures which either ſuite or ſerve to their ends; yet is no deſire ſo wiſely impetuous as that which origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from reaſon, is ſeconded by the aſſurance of unqueſtionable Experience; nor do we ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe any thing ſo undoubtedly, which hath not the probate of a cleer evidence, to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of which the life of man (pleaſured by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then generous and pious ſociety) is a clear and noble inſtance. That therefore Man, the Epitome of this Microcoſm, and the little Lord (next under his MAKER) of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Pile of Divine Architecture, might not miſtake his match, <hi>and while he ought to ſeek a Kingdom, find aſſes;</hi> or by vain deluſions, and pretended nothings miſs the Mark of Eternity, and the Pawn of an unerring Conduct to that <hi>Canaan;</hi> This Scripture, like a goodly Glaſſe rightly modelled, and truly hung to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans view, ſhews him the moſt reall and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable object of the Soul, illuſtrated from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of its nature, pure, unmixt, neither capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be tempted or to tempt; unleſſe it be to a holy Love and happy Acquaintance, which ends not worſe, but better then it began, in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Peace, and in eternall bleſſe, abandoning evill either of <hi>ſin or ſufferings;</hi> all which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in theſe Words, <hi>Acquaint, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Me thinks my Meditations fix on a double ſort of ſubjects in this Scripture: <hi>Self, GOD, Peace, Evill;</hi> in their natures different, for what leſſe harmonius then corruption and incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then good and evill, then the beſt we wiſh and the worſt we fear? yet both accorded and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153739:4"/>united in the Term, <hi>Acquaint.</hi> Man who ought to be linked to God by the bond of Love, as well as ſubjected to him by the Law of obedience (as he hath no adverſary to fear, ſo no good to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire beyond that Monarch GOD: who is all to the ſoul by way of completion, and to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man by way of munition) by this means, may obtain felicity in <hi>Acquainting himſelf with GOD,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There is ſo much Treaſure in this Scripture, that the rich Spoils of it are beyond the capacity of men to conceive, or Angels to language; I ſhall confine my thoughts to theſe enſuing Heads, as the Tracts by which to come to the Manſion of holy Comfort reſiding in it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>What is meant by Acquaintance with GOD.</hi> 2. <hi>How it is to be attained.</hi> 3. <hi>What Peace it is that thoſe have which attain it.</hi> 4. <hi>How it may be ſaid to repell evill from us.</hi> 5. <hi>When this is to be ſought after; Theſe diſcuſſed, will enodate the obſcurity, and preſent the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in its true and Princely Dreſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OF the Firſt (<hi>Acquaintance with GOD:</hi>) I ſhall ſay in the Pſalmiſts Phraſe,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 87.3.</note> 
               <hi>Glorious things are ſpoken of thee,</hi> O thou light ſprung from on high, thou ray of eternity, to which all mortall contents and Mundane confedracies are but as atoms, yea non-entities. <hi>Acquaintance with God</hi> is ſomwhat ſtupendious, and requires a touch from the Altar to decypher it; 'tis a beam of glory darting on the face of a Child of glory,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153739:5"/>a Love-token erranded to ſignifie the good will of him that dwels in the Buſh, to his that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the pots, ſlurred amongſt the brambles, ſcratched; in the fire and in the water, abuſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed, but not forſaken; but this is rather an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it then a Deſcription of it, that which forms it is the being, and that which expatiates it is the wel-being of it: For the more this grace (for leſſe it is not) is meditated upon, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are the touches of ſweetneſſe in the Souls vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, from this lovely Penſill of the moſt lovely Artiſt, GOD: And therefore I ſhall conceive it to aſcend its Zenith by theſe Gradations.</p>
            <p n="1">

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> that muſt know him the chief good, or elſe it will never deſire him; mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect is the Bucket by which he drawes, and the Ladder at which he climbs to will and wed; the object he knowes good, without this 'tis as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to love and obey, as without eyes to judge of colours, or without taſte to diſcriminate Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor and Meats, God hath given the priority to this faculty as that which muſt ſeaſon to, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare appoſitely for the reſt. And truly, this is of the foundation and reall nature of the rationall ſoul; for from this are we determined to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy (as to other creatures) of that Supremacy and juriſdiction God hath given us over them; for did not our Underſtandings direct us to a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage proportionate to the natures of Creatures, and things, we ſhould ſoon diſcover our follies to be too brutiſh either to be admired or followed, and the Creation would ſoon renite obedience to ſo ſenſleſſe Governours. But bleſſed be God,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153739:5"/>he hath not left us without a witneſſe of his libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. He hath informed our ſpecious bodies with perfect ſouls, and made a noble Lodging of State for himſelf, that high room, and top battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, our Underſtanding; which though too vaſt to be filled with the little puncto's and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible grains of worldly nothings, yet receives completion from God, and thoſe apprehenſions of him which he (in much condeſcenſion to us) is pleaſed to vouchſafe us, not to make us proud of our fatneſſe, but provident to improve fulneſſe to gratitude, and to ſerve him more compleatly; who does good and is good, and from whom goodneſſe effluxeth to all creatures: for of his fulneſſe they receive fulneſſe.</p>
            <p>That this Underſtanding is the Key of Diſcovery, and <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> needs no ſecond to confirm it; for even nature tels us by the Rule, that there is no deſire of what we know not,
<note place="margin">Ignoti nulla cupido.</note> and Scripture directs to this as the path to all gracious Intercourſe with God; in one paſſage of holy Writ I hear this aſſerted,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 9.10.</note> 
               <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee;</hi> in another, <hi>He that cometh to GOD, muſt believe that he is.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> Now effects imply cauſes, as Ciſterns do Springs, and Rivers Seas: If God be to be believed on, he muſt be conceived of, and underſtood by thoſe that thus believe him; for as articulation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to generation, ſo is adhaeſion to aſſent, and aſſent to intellect.</p>
            <p>The neceſſity of intellect to head the will and affections, which in a ſort compleat acqaintance, is evincible from many things: from the order of God in Creation &amp; Nature, which makes this as the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153739:6"/>womb, at which port every thing which tends in its progreſſe to action, enters. The light natural, typicall of this internall Luminary, was the firſt Creature; as that which God erected to give light to his Library, the World, which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled of nothing, by a power eternal, complete, and indeterminable; and the firſt tryall hee put man upon, was to touch his Intellect, and to try the magnetiſme of that faculty, which could draw all things to it, and incorporate it ſelf with every thing: And if when there was no diſtortion, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fote the miſ-rule which ſin and Satan brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Underſtanding; this was the tendency of that Faculty; It muſt ſtill remain what it was, as to the Nature and ſacred Deſign of God, though vayled and denegrated by acceſſions of ſin, and contractions of puniſhments, which by underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any thing but God, and in order to God, is juſt up on it.</p>
            <p>The faculty then is the ſame in its nature, in its imployment; onely the Roſe hath prickles, the Swan deformed legs: <hi>Death is in the pot,</hi> if God doth not heal the waters, and turn our Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to that right object, Himſelf; <hi>whom to know is life eternal,</hi> And whom to glorifie as God, our moſt excellent and onely good, is the ſole end of our creation.</p>
            <p>Nor is the order of God in Creation, the only Inſtance of this precedence of the Intellect; but experience atteſts this in the whole latitude of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the Heavens; by that inſtinct they have, as it were, and after their kind, do their duty to earth, Man, nay their Maker; by a duct (which to them is in ſtead of Intellect) do they ſerve times and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153739:6"/>ſeaſons; do they remit, and extend influence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law of their firſt Cauſe; and the Birds and Beaſts, by their ſenſual Energy (<hi>analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous</hi> in ſome ſort to Intelect in man) direct their courſe, and run their race; not attempting to love or flye that which is not Good or Evil in their eye, and pleaſing or diſpleaſing to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Now if that rule of the Schools be true, which neither is yet, nor ever will be contradicted, That the work of Nature is the work of the God of Nature:
<note place="margin">Opus Naturae eſt opus Authe ris.</note> then what is the concurrent practice of Univerſal Nature, according to its ſpecifick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, muſt be Poſitive and Abſolute, and ſo from him who is the Beginning and End of all things, and therefore moſt true. And ſo I have mounted the firſt Step, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> Acquaintance imports Underſtanding; for how ſhall Deſire be heightned, but from Knowledge; and Knowledg be gained, but by that Faculty,
<note place="margin">Rom 10.14.</note> which is admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and receptive of it? <hi>How can they</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how can they hear without a Preacher?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this Step conſummative to our Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, if here we ſtay, pitching this as the <hi>Non ultra,</hi> beyond which we will not go: for God hath placed his Seat on High, and the Rounds of the Ladder which reacheth him are many; he will have us engaged in much colluctation, many brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things and pantings, before we come up to the Mount of Mercy, where Peace is, and Evil is not; and therefore he cryes out to man, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Step. </seg>2</label> in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, for his <hi>Heart,</hi> his <hi>Will,</hi> which is the Jewel in this Cabinet of Glory: This, this to the Intellect, is as the Sailes to the Ship; takes the Winds gales,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153739:7"/>and carrys it to the Port of Loſs or Gain: this, this is the Womb in which are the Iſſues of life and death: this, this is the Paradiſe, which we ought to guard with the <hi>Flaming Sword</hi> of an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and earneſt Zeal; for as the Sailes move the Ship, by reaſon of the wind which acts upon them, and ſo is cauſal of their ſwelling, as they of the Ships motion; and according to the quantity of the wind, ſo ordinatily is the way of the Ship: ſo doth this act upon the Intellects premiſes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting whatever hath the Watch-word from that Centinel. I ſay not, that the Will alwayes followes the rectified Underſtanding:
<note place="margin">Bonum &amp; velle convertuntur.</note> but this I ſay, No man wills what is evil under the notion of evil, for the Wil and Good are convertible; and many great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt evils have ſome good in conjunction with them, for which they are admitted, though as to the predominant parts of them, they deſervedly be termed and judged Evil; for whatever erreth from the perfect Rule of Gods Law, and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Image of God in the ſoul, hath not the allowance of Heaven to make it currant.</p>
            <p>Now this Will of man is highly concerned to the completion of reaſonable Actions, it being the <hi>vehiculum</hi> which carries the Intellect to its Object, and thereto unites it: the Underſtanding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the Match, but the Will tyes the knot and adunates; as I muſt know before I can will, ſo muſt I will before I can be acquainted with that I will; which is the reaſon why between things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe there is no acquaintance properly ſo called, but rather an Antitheſis and Retrogade Motion; Contraryes meet not, nor cohabit they in intenſe degrees, in the ſame Subject at one and the ſame
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153739:7"/>time, becauſe they are inconſiſtent, and are made what they are by the non being of each other: Fire is no fire, if water prevail againſt it, for it is ſuppreſſed and led captive by the Victor; and ſo water ceaſeth its moyſture and liquidity, if the heat of the fire accede it to Maſtery; whereas other things that are not at this variance, meet like Mercy and Peace, and kiſs each other: Active heat, and Paſſive moiſture, make way for Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Steel and the Load-Stone are in amity, and do with eagerneſs approach each other; ſo is it in Love, by the will diſpoſed of to any object. There is no Soveraign more abſolute, as to things ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to his will, then the will of man; for it wheels about the <hi>totum mobile</hi> in him. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Samſon</hi> to love <hi>Dalilah, Archimedes</hi> to dye with his Art; <hi>Judas</hi> to betray his Maſter, <hi>Julian</hi> to Apoſtatize; and by Gods ſeverity, this ſeals, as the meritorius Cauſe, the wicked under unbelief, that they <hi>may be damned who have pleaſure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs:</hi> for this once perverted and engaged,
<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.12.</note> the whole man is circumferred and hurled after the genius of its project: by this are the affections alarm'd and keened to good or evil; and without this Velliety is nothing feaſible, without the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God come to aid; yea, and that too deales mildly, by a ſweet compulſion and inſuperable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, transforming the ſoul from what it is, and as corrupted, would; into what it is not, but ought to be: ſubmiſſive <hi>to,</hi> ſequacious <hi>of,</hi> and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily captived <hi>by</hi> God.</p>
            <p>Now all the quarters of the inner man are beat up, and Proclamation is made in the name of the great King of Heaven: now the word is, I am not

            <p>I anſwer, Yes: it is the way to outward peace truly ſo called, that is, to ſanctified outward peace, which is peace in a proper and ſavoury ſenſe: Meer ſerenity of ſtate, is as far from bleſſing, as eaſe is from health; which ſeldom is propagated by it, but often impeached and deflowred. When peace and proſperity is beſtowed upon bad men, 'tis to reward ſome good thing in them: ſome ſervice they have done God; God leaves not thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded, whom <hi>his own bounty,</hi> not <hi>their propenſions</hi>

When I am in Meditation of Heaven, I rather pray for a warm heart, and keen affections; for abilities to believe in, and adhere to God, then for curious Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and pathetick words; and therefore ſince faith muſt ſupply what ſenſe cannot attain to, and thoſe things that are ſecret and ineffable, are rather to be adored, then ſearched into, or written upon; I can here conclude this part of my Meditation in the Wiſemans words, <hi>The knowledg of this is too Wonderful for me, it is high, I cannot attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</hi>

            <p>Peace and Evil are here oppoſed, not more in the words then ſenſe.

            <p>And it were well if men would try the ſpirits that now are abroad, for Satan is often a Lying ſpirit in the mouth of Prophets, and a Prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit in the mouth of Lyers: and if he durſt mingle himſelf with the Sons of God, when they came before him of old, may he not now be well miſtruſted:
<note place="margin">Job 1.6.</note> though he quote Scripture with the zeal of a Seraphim, and in the meetings of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians pray and ſpeak with notable evidence; he who durſt appear before Chriſt with Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to his own purpoſe,
<note place="margin">Matth. 4.6.</note> dare do the like to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whoſe weakneſs is more opportune to his Conqueſt. He is that Evil one, who in his

And Agents; not men of triffling talents, who need vulgar helps to make them eminent; but men of great parts, noble wits, yea often noted lives; ſpeaking to wonder, writing to amazement, living to envy and example; the Leaders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſometimes cauſed them to err; <hi>The Prieſts divined a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 9.16.</note> the Divel of <hi>Sauls</hi> heart (in <hi>Samuels</hi> fleſh as it were) is potent enough to miſguide milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

The Romane come and take away our Religion, and (I pray God) not our place and Nation.</p>
            <p>Is not this evil of the Divels deſigning? Is not the hand of hells <hi>Joab,</hi> Satan in it, but the ſword of the Lord and of his <hi>Gideon</hi> Chriſt Jeſus ſhall prevent this, though none ſtand in the gap; no <hi>Moſes</hi> intercedes, no <hi>Phineas</hi> executes Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet this Plague ſhall ceaſe; God for his own nameſake will turn thoſe Locuſts (the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its) back to their quarters; and make their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign as a red ſea to bury themſelves in.

            <p>Well, we have a ſight of Satan in his power, and agents; now ſee him in his Policy and end, which is to cut off <hi>Samſons locks;</hi> to deſtroy the <hi>Males of Iſrael;</hi> to ruine all the Smithes and Forges by which our Spiritual weapons ſhould be edged to oppoſe him, and defend our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his aſſaults; thus did the Philiſtims of old to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.9.

            <p>And now is not cuſtody from this evil an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Bleſſing? Is it not as rain to the parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed graſs, and ought we not to receive this Mercy with the joy of Harveſt?

            <p>What ſhall I ſay more againſt this which is ſo diſhonourable to God, and ought to be execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his people? but in the words of <hi>Moſes, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be he that continues not in all the words of the Law to do them;</hi> that is, who deſires not to give ſin the foil, by a contrary and conſtant courſe of virtue, according to the will of God in his Word, and the aſſiſtance he hath from God in this Race to complete this reſolution; for without that we can do nothing.</p>
            <p>Wel then, to be helped from this evil, is a mercy, a conſequent of Gods peace with the ſoul; that is clear from the Prophet, <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace</hi> (or neerer the Original, <hi>in peace, peace</hi>) <hi>whoſe heart is ſtayed on thee, becauſe hee trusteth in

He was with <hi>Noah in the Ark,</hi> to keep him from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of out-living the Floud, which drowned the world; with <hi>Moſes</hi> in the wilderneſs, to preſerve him from disbanding his rude multitude, whom God deſigned for <hi>Canaan,</hi> and inclining him to bear the petulancies of popularities; rather then chuſe the contents of a private retirement: He was with <hi>David</hi> in his flights from <hi>Saul,</hi> and fights with Philiſtims: And kept him from deſponding, upon aſſurance of a Kingdom for his reward: He was with <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the Dungeon, and with <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Whales belly; to ſweeten ſtraights to his, and to make them more pure in their enlargements. He was with <hi>Peters</hi> tongue, converting thouſands at a Sermon, and making his pride do pennance where it offended, yea, weep out its own retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
